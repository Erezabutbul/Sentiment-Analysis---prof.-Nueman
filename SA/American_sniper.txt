CHRIS: It may have been the leather pants. 
TAYA: Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?  
CHRIS: Maybe corduroy. 
TAYA: Is that how it is with you guys you are like suddenly single after three beers?  
CHRIS: Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth.  
TAYA: That is great. A real red-neck. 
CHRIS: I am no redneck, I am from Texas.  
TAYA: What is the difference? 
CHRIS: We ride horses, they ride their cousins.  
TAYA: What do you do for work? You look like military.  
CHRIS: I polish dolphins. They are in captivity, what I do is sort of scrape off crustaceans.  
TAYA: Do I look stupid to you? 
CHRIS: To be honest, you look a little sad. (Beat) So am I tall enough to buy you a drink?  
TAYA: Not until you tell me what you do. 
CHRIS: How about this; How about we do a shot for a question. Every time you ask a question you gotta do a shot and same, vise versa.  
TAYA: Game on.  
CHRIS: You can lead the ball too. Ok, shoot.  
TAYA: Ok. You are obviously military. What branch?  
CHRIS: Iâ€™m just finishing BUD/S and sniper school.  
TAYA: Are you kidding me? You are a SEAL?  
CHRIS: That was two questions...  
TAYA: Shit. (She takes two shots) 
CHRIS: Oh I did not really mean you had to do that.  
TAYA: I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL.  
CHRIS: Oh was she? How do you know all about us, what do you mean? 
TAYA: You are a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. I would never date a SEAL.  
CHRIS: How can you say we are self-centered? I would lay down my life for my country.  
TAYA: Why?  
CHRIS: Cause it is the greatest country on earth and I believe it is worth protecting. I am sorry this guy hurt your sister but that is not me. Nice to meet you.  
TAYA: Where are you going? 
CHRIS :I am just going to go home because you said you would never date a SEAL. 
TAYA: I said I would never marry one.  
CHRIS: Oh, Ok. Well them maybe hello...Nice to meet you, what is your name? 
TAYA: Taya.  
CHRIS: Taya. I am Chris Kyle. Nice to meet you,  
TAYA: Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, is not it Chris?  
CHRIS: Our BUD/S officer commanders say there is three things we have to worry about: ego, liquor, and women. 
TAYA: Sounds like you are under attack.
